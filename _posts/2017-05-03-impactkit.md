The Impact Kit is a three-day course in which participants follow advanced
lectures and get a chance to obtain some hands-on experience on the LHCb
software. Projects are proposed, and in addition participants are encouraged to
bring their own problems to the table.

Practical information, such as the course timetable and event location, is 
available on the [Indico page]({{ page.indico }}).
