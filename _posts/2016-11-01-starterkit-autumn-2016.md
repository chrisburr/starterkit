Fasten your seatbelts! The LHCb Starterkit is taking off for the third time.

This year's Starterkit will be held from the 28th of November to the 2nd of
December 2016 at CERN.

Registration is now open! You can find all necessary information, including the
registration form on [the Indico page for the event][indico].

The deadline to register is the 28th of October at 1500 CET. We expect the 
event to be very popular, so please make sure to register as soon as possible.
Spots will be assigned on a first-come first-served basis. The registration fee 
of CHF 20 needs to be paid to the LHCb secretariat in advance of the workshop.
It will be used to finance coffee breaks and a social event.

Should you have any further questions, you can contact us at [by email][email].

Please keep in mind that this event is specifically designed for early PhD
students, or advanced Masters students. If you are not sure whether the
Starterkit is at an appropriate level for you, you can have a look at [last
year's lessons][first-ana-steps].

If you are taking on new PhD students this year, please consider bringing this
workshop to their attention.
